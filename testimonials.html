                <p class="p-test left">"Very impressed with their services and level of professionalism! I wasn't even aware I needed answers, but boy did I! When I was initially picked up for the program, it was at an inconvenient time, when I was all alone, but they made the process <span class="sub1">pain free</span> and actually quite enjoyable. It may have appeared I was crying, but those were tears of joy." - Terrestrial Q.</p>

                <p class="p-test right">"I highly recommend Pro-Bing!, they are there when you don't even know you need them. I was once a lowly human lacky. But after my experience within Pro-Bing! facilities, I have become a highborne feline. I lay waste to all the lesser forms that do not change my litter or serve me canned wet foods. Now the humans are at my finger tips! Thanks Pro-Bing!" - Sir Fluffs McMeowington</p>

                <p class="p-test left">"Jim and I are so happy with their services, and recommend Pro-Bing! for all new couples! We don't know what they did to us, but we are a happier couple after having shared such an experience together. Paul was our "guide" and helped us with all our questions we never really wanted answers to, but are happier now that we have them." - Betty & Jim P.</p>

                <p class="p-test right">"When I was picked up to receive Pro-Bing!'s services, I wasn't initially happy. It was a quiet night, when I was all alone grooming my pet goldfish, Albert. However, it turned out to be a great trip! Upon entering the facility, I was greeted with big smiling faces, who were happy to guide me through my first probing. While I am still sore, days later, I now have answers I never knew I needed. " - Ed F.</p>
